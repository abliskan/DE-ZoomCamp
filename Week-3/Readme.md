# MODULE-3: DATA WAREHOUSE
## Introduction
A data warehouse is a data repository that provides data storage and compute, usually leveraging SQL queries for data analytics use cases. <br> 

Cloud data warehousing offers a range of solutions that can benefit an organization. Here are some of the most common data warehouse use cases:
- Making real-time decisions: Analyze data in real time to proactively address challenges, identify opportunities, gain efficiency, reduce costs, and proactively respond to business events.
- Consolidating siloed data: Quickly pull data from multiple structured sources across your organization, such as point-of-sale systems, websites, and email lists, and bring it together into one location so that you can perform analysis and get insights.
- Enabling business reporting and ad hoc analysis: Keep historical data on a separate server from operational data so that end users can access it and run their own queries and reports without impacting the performance of operational systems or waiting to get help from IT.
- Implementing machine learning and AI: Collect historical and real-time data to develop algorithms that can provide predictive insights, such as anticipating traffic spikes or suggesting relevant products to a customer browsing a website. <br> 

BigQuery is Googleâ€™s fully managed, serverless data warehouse that enables scalable analysis over petabytes of data.
